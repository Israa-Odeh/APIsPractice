# APIsPractice
### Project Overview:
Within this project, I've chosen two APIs to explore and practice the implementation of GET and POST methods using Scala. 
The weatherapi API is utilized for obtaining specific city weather data through the GET method, while the JSON Placeholder
API is employed to create and post new content using the POST method.

This project encompasses Scala code designed to interact with specific APIs for different purposes. It primarily contains
two main Scala files which are: WeatherAPI_GET and JSONPlaceholderAPI_POST.

## WeatherAPI_GET
### Description:
This Scala code is designed to interact with the WeatherAPI for retrieving weather data related to a specific entered city
or a predefined list of Palestinian cities. It facilitates the execution of HTTP GET requests, parses JSON responses, and 
stores weather information in structured text files.

### Features:
Enables users to:
- Access weather information for a particular city.
- Acquire weather details for a list of Palestinian cities.


## JSONPlaceholderAPI_POST
### Description:
This Scala code emulates an HTTP POST request to the JSON Placeholder API, exemplifying the process of initiating a POST 
request, receiving a response, and formatting the extracted JSON data into an easily understandable structure.

### Features:
- Simulates a POST request to the JSON Placeholder API's 'posts' endpoint to publish post content.
- Organizes the parsed JSON response into readable fields.
